== Configuring Wheeler == 
Plug in your joystick(s). After launching Wheeler, you can edit your configuration by pressing 'c'.

For each input you'd like to configure, turn your wheel, push a button, or a pedal, and press enter when you're done.

To remove a selection, press the delete (not backspace) key.

If you do not want to display the clutch (or throttle, or brake) input, clear the input selection for that pedal and hit enter to skip it.

Similarly, if you're using a sequential shifter, you will want to configure a control for shift up and shift down, while leaving gears 1 through 7 and reverse blank, so that gear information will not be shown.

== OBS setup ==
While Wheeler will work with Open Broadcaster, fancy non-greenscreen transparency is only possible in OBS Multiplatform.

1. Run wheeler.exe to start the application
2. Open OBS Multiplatform
3. Add a new game capture
4. In the game capture dialog,
    a. disable "Capture any fullscreen application"
    b. select wheeler.exe from the "Window" dropdown
    c. enable "Allow Transparency"
5. Make sure that this new game capture is displayed on top of your fullscreen game capture
